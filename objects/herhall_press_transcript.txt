Rep. Clint Moses, WI Assembly District 29
thank you what a great day to come out
and celebrate this occasion it is an
even better today to be a blue devil I
am proud to be here standing in front of
Heritage Hall what looks like Heritage
Hall now will not be the same pretty
soon as many of you know
obviously I'd like to thank the members
of joint Finance
who saw the value in this project and
made sure that it was added to our
budget you know I wanted to wait until
it was actually signed by our governor
because this project was not part of his
initial budget and we had to fight very
hard to get this as part of our state
budget this cycle since I was elected
and I should introduce myself for those
of you that don't know me I'm
representative Clint Moses and I'm proud
to represent Menominee Dunn County and
Saint Croix County and a little bit of
Polk but also I'm a UW Stout alumni as
well I graduated with probably the most
useful at degrees from UW Stout I have a
degree in Psychology which comes in very
handy when dealing with all the
interesting people that visit us at the
Capitol and dealing with colleagues as
well so
um since I forgot my introduction I
figured here should cover that but
you know this was a pretty easy sell
although a lot of work was put in it was
an easy sell with our colleagues because
UW Stout has always produced the type of
workers that Wisconsin needs I always
say that UW stelt was Polytechnic before
Polytechnic was even a thing
you know my dad graduated from here with
in industrial Arts shop teacher degree
and went on to teach a lot of people in
the Chippewa Valley how to do things
from sheet metal Plumbing ivac work
electrical you name it so Stout has
always had a tradition of teaching the
skills that we need in our Workforce
this expansion at Heritage Hall will
more than double the capacity of
students that will be coming through
this particular building and I hope it
will continue to attract the very best
students to our region and to our state
UW UW Stout also has a great record of
obviously job placement and retention of
our workers within the state of
Wisconsin so all of those factors were
really a big issue when it came to
selling this with our colleagues I'm
proud to be here with the only other
representative that is also UW Stout
alumni and he's going to be up next so
with that I'll welcome representative
Rob Summers field
Rep. Rob Summerfield, WI Assembly District 67
yes thank you representative Moses this
is a great day to be here like
representative Moses said I am also
alumni of UW Stout but more importantly
I do represent part of Dunn County uh
through the last seven years so once I
first got elected uh you know this
conversation started Chancellor Frank
came to UW Stout and really really made
the big push we had the joint finance
budget Roadshow hearing here two years
ago uh to really show The Joint Finance
committees the needs of Heritage Hall
and what the potential is for the
workforce and to grow our community here
in Western Wisconsin unfortunately last
budget it didn't make it through it
didn't make it to the finish line but
going into this uh this budget this year
working with representative Moses and
other colleagues throughout this area
we really worked hard along with uh
Chancellor Frank and her team here at UW
Stout to show the importance of this
building not only to the state for our
region but to the state of Wisconsin
like my colleague represent Moses has
said UW sellers are very to me one of
the most unique campuses uh in the
nation uh they really really have
transformed what we produced to bring
for the workforce the graduates that
come you know to the needs I know
working with Chancellor Frank going
around the other offices uh explaining
to why we need this uh renovation at
Heritage Hall and the list of companies
throughout not only this area but the
nation that Heritage Hall will help
produce to bring further's Workforce so
I'm glad Muslim invited today was very
happy to work with my colleague
represent Moses and the other area
legislators with UW Stout to get this
project to the finish line so once again
thank you and next up I get your news uh
Chancellor Frank
Katherine Frank, Chancellor, UW-Stout
well hello everybody this is exciting I
can't wipe the smile off my face
um a huge thank you to the to
representative Moses and representative
Summerfield
um and their colleagues for the strong
support of this project we could not
have done this without them and we are
so grateful for your investment in
Wisconsin's Polytechnic University and
everything that you do for our community
and so for more than 50 years UW Stout's
graduates have been well served by this
building and our state has benefited
from their many talented contributions
throughout our Workforce with a near
perfect graduate employment rate and
with approximately 60 percent of those
graduates remaining in the Wisconsin we
place students in the Wisconsin
Workforce better than any other higher
education institution in the state
and thanks to your efforts and those of
our alumni Statewide industry and
business partners Community Advocates
and University employees and students
now future Stout students and others
will learn and collaborate in a
state-of-the-art building that will
amplify our impact on our state's
economy
and it was a journey to fund Heritage
Hall it began almost 15 years ago and
this renovation couldn't be more
critical than it is today Wisconsin
faces immediate Workforce challenges
from child care and education to mental
health and Manufacturing to housing and
tourism and we are projected to need
even more dedicated skilled
wisconsinites in the decade to come
this renovated building the applied
research and learning it will inspire
the Community Resources it will provide
and the business and industry Partners
it will support will allow Stout as
Wisconsin's Polytechnic University to
provide solutions to these challenges
and during my tenures Chancellor I have
heard these challenges echoed by UW
Stout's business and industry Partners
throughout the state from these
individuals behind me our neighbors
throughout the community they are
challenges that impact our economy and
our communities and I'm grateful so
grateful that our state legislature and
the governor recognize that Heritage
Hall and a Polytechnic education that
emphasizes career-focused applied
learning in collaboration with business
and industry Partners as part of the
solution to lead Wisconsin forward
and for decades the degree programs
housed in Heritage Hall have produced
career-ready teachers school and
clinical Mental Health Counselors police
officers food scientists property
managers directors of hotels restaurants
and tourism and other high demand
professionals who even before they
graduate provide Direct Services where
they are needed most the revitalization
of Heritage Hall will ensure more of
tomorrow's graduates are prepared with
the Hands-On applied experience to
address the challenges on our doorstep
and as you've heard the Heritage Hall
renovation will double the number of
students served by the building to more
than four thousand a year and it will
save taxpayers more than 10 million
dollars a year in projected inflation
costs that would have been incurred by
further delays the return on investment
is easy to calculate and the value is
very very clear
and you will find Stout's distinct
Polytechnic education at work across
Wisconsin Stout graduates are the
backbone of our communities both large
and small they are committed
they are we are stout proud and it is
our mission at UW Stout Wisconsin's only
Polytechnic University to continue to
prepare the generations to come to help
create an even better Wisconsin thank
you all so much and it is my great
pleasure to introduce Justin new paddle
who will talk a little bit about the
facilities thank you
Justin Utpadel, Director of Facilities, UW-Stout
good morning
when it opened in the early 1970s
Heritage Hall reflected the architecture
of its era since its construction the
building has provided a strong
foundation for career-focused stealth
students
but the technology driven needs of today
and those of our industry Partners
across the state demand more
UW stalt's ability to repurpose Heritage
Hall after 50 years of evolving service
to students and to the Wisconsin
communities has come to an end
a 2020 independent review of The
Building Systems confirmed its internal
utilities are exhausted
thanks to the support of Representative
Moses representative Summerfield and
their colleagues we will revive Heritage
Halls systems and insurance service for
generations to come
with their support the students of
Heritage Hall will prepare for their
careers in new future focused Learning
Centers aligned with Wisconsin's
Workforce needs they will train in
state-of-the-art labs and multi-purpose
classrooms they will serve our community
through Modern Early Childhood
Rehabilitation and clinical service
centers
and the university in the state will
share credit for a cost-efficient
investment that saves Wisconsin's
taxpayers an estimated 10 million
dollars a year and in costs related to
further delay of the project
all of those benefits are within sight
as the senior facilities officer and a
graduate of Stout's construction program
I'm proud to say that final design for
the Heritage Hall renovation project
will be ready within a year
and we will bid for construction in Fall
of 2024.
when completed
Heritage Hall will provide students the
means to lead Wisconsin's Workforce
forward into the future
